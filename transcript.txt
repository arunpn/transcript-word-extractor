Transcript:
(00:00) I asked on Twitter, "Who's the best product   manager you've worked with?"  You were the most mentioned. My take is that your scope is the world. Nothing  should ever perceive as being out of bounds. VP of product at Figma told me,   "Mahika is really great at creating a vision  and getting people to see what she sees.
(00:16) " We lean heavily into designing and  prototyping even before a project gets   a green light. If you and your team do your  job correctly, what does the world look like? Say somebody wants to make their culture  more entrepreneurial, what does it take? We have this concept called Maker  Week, which is our internal hackathon,   giving people the breathing space to see ahead  into the horizon and be wildly ambitious.
(00:43) Today, my guest is Mahika Kapoor. Mahika  is a design engineering PM hybrid at Figma,   where she was an early PM on FigJam, and  is now spearheading development of a new   product that the company's going to launch in  June. She's known as the go-to person at Figma   for leading new zero-to-one products.
(01:01)   And as you'll hear in our conversation,   is beloved by everybody that works with her.  Prior to Figma, Mahika founded Design Nation,   a national nonprofit that democratizes  undergraduate student access to a design   education, and led several products and launches  at Meta, focused on commerce and creators.  On this podcast, I bring on a lot of amazing  senior product leaders, but there's so much we can   learn from stellar on-the-ground product managers  like Mahika.
(01:27) In our conversation, we drill into   many of the skills that Mahika has cultivated  that have contributed to her success, including   how to develop a compelling vision, get buy-in for  your ideas, how to develop conviction, empathy,   the importance of culture, and how to create  a culture on your team and within the company,   and also how to deal with the constant change  that happens within successful organizations. 
(01:47) We also spent a bunch of time on how to  effectively bring new ideas in your company   from zero to one to launch, including getting to  a bunch of the stories behind some of Figma's most   successful products and features, and how many of  them began at hackathons and Maker Weeks. Mahika   is a truly special product manager and leader, and  I feel fortunate to have had this chance to learn   from her. We went quite long on this conversation,  but honestly, this could have gone for another two  
(02:12) hours. With that, I bring you Mahika Kapoor,  after a short word from our sponsors. And if   you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe  and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or   YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future  episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. 
(02:29) This episode is brought to you by Paragon, the  embedded integration platform for B2B SaaS product   development teams. Are your users constantly  requesting new integrations with other SaaS   platforms that they use? Unfortunately, native  product integrations take months of engineering   to build, and the maintenance never ends.
(02:51) Paragon  enables your engineering team to ship integrations   seven times faster than building in-house by  removing the complexities around authentication,   messy third-party APIs, and debugging  integration errors. Engineering teams at   companies like Copy.ai, Cinch, TLDB, and over 100  other SaaS companies are using Paragon so they can   focus their efforts on core product features,  not integrations.
(03:15) The result? Their shipping   integrations on demand, which has led to higher  product usage, better retention, and more customer   upsells. Visit useparagon.com/lenny to see how  Paragon can help you go to market faster with   integrations today. That's useparagon. com/lenny.
(03:36) This episode is brought to you by Lenny's Job   Board. As many of you may or may not know, for  the past couple of years I've been running a   recruiting service. I've introduced over 30  companies to their next hire and helped build   a candidate pipeline for tons more. I've been  fortunate to work with companies like Ramp, Figma,   Shopify, many more, plus a bunch of exciting  young startups connecting each to extremely   talented engineers, designers, and product  leaders that make up my community.
(03:59) Because   of its success and the value that it's driven  to companies and to people looking for jobs,   we're ramping up the service in a big way.  I'm beta testing a bespoke headhunting style   service and I'm opening up a handful of slots.  We work with a select group of companies each   month.
(04:17) If you need to make a key product hire or  quickly expand your team, I'd love to see if I can   help head to Lennysjobs.com/talent and hit meet  candidates to get started lennysjobs.com/talent.  Mahika, thank you so much for being  here and welcome to the podcast. Thank you for having me, Lenny. I am a huge   fan of the podcast and really  excited to be chatting today. Just to set expectations, this is going to  be a Mahika love-fest podcast.
(04:43) And what I   want to try to do with our time here is have an  archeology of Mahika to understand what you've   learned about product and building product, in  particular because you are thriving at Figma,   which is one of the most interesting and  successful tech companies in the world   with one of the best product teams in the world.
(05:05)   So, basically, I just want to learn as much as I   can from what you've learned and what you've  done in order to create more Mahikas in the   world. That's kind of my goal here because  I feel like that would [inaudible 00:05:11]. Mildly frightening. In a very cool way, not in a creepy way.
(05:21) So,  what I did to prep for this conversation is I,   as I said, reached out to a bunch of your  colleagues at Figma to ask what you're   especially strong at. And what I want to do is  kind of go through some of these key skills,   and they're essentially the core attributes  of great product managers and learn from you,   learn from what you learned about  how doing these things well,   and just what you do to be successful  at these things.
(05:40) How does that sound? That sounds good. One thing to call out is that  I think when I think about my own PM style,   it's definitely not a tick-all-the-boxes style.  There are plenty of things that I'm very bad at   that PMs are traditionally supposed to be great  at, so happy to chat about what makes sense. Okay, that's actually really cool.
(06:03) So, let's save  that for the end, the things you think you're bad   at. The way I see this is a reverse performance  review. Here's all the things you're amazing at,   let's just go spend all our time on that. But  I think that's going to be really important.   But just along those lines, what I'm hearing is  there's a sense of do the things you are good   at really well. This is a trend on the podcast,  is lean into your strengths.
(06:21) Is that the way you   see it? Do you have thoughts along those lines  of just the fact that you've been successful,   knowing you have these things you're  not amazing at? Then we'll talk. It's important to have two things. One is of  course lean into your strengths. I think that   PMing is traditionally a sort of generalist role  and people fall into it in a number of ways.
(06:42) But   most often than not, I hear people fall into  it by trying a bunch of other things and then   realizing that, "Oh, hey, maybe this PM thing  makes more sense for me." So, for me personally,   it was I have always been a very left brain,  right brain kind of a person. I majored in   CS and minored in visual arts.
(07:06) And when I worked  as a software engineer, I really missed the design   side, and when I worked as a designer, I missed  the technical. And moving into product was a   really great way to kind of straddle both and have  more touch points across the product development   cycle. And so, I think that based on how you  fell into it, you might have different spikes   and different strengths and leaning into those is  really important.
(07:25) But for the other things, it's   also of course important to have a growth mindset  and to constantly be conquering what comes next. Okay, cool. Okay, so I'll save the stuff  you think you're bad at for later. Let's   start with the stuff you're basic at. Okay.  So, the first is vision. So, Sho Kuwamoto,   VP of product at Figma told me that, "Mahika is  really great at creating a vision and getting   people to see what she sees.
(07:50) She's working on a  new project now and put together one of the best   pitches I've ever seen internally at what it could  become, why it'd be differentiated, et cetera. And   like every new project, this had up and downs, but  she's incredibly driven to keep the flame alive   throughout these ups and downs.
(08:07) " Can you just talk  about what you've learned about doing this well,   creating a compelling vision, getting people  excited, getting buy-in for big ideas? Yeah, absolutely. So, my take is that vision is  everything. It is really important to create a   vision that you believe in, that your team  believes in and that your company believes   in.
(08:32) Because the reality of the product  development cycle is that it's so messy,   it's so chaotic. You're going to have extreme  highs and extreme lows. You're going to march   in a certain direction only to hear from your  users that it might just be the wrong direction,   and totally pivot. And in order to ensure  that moments that are not discouraging,   but rather, learning opportunities for your  team team, it's so important to be anchored   on that singular vision because then any step  along the way feels like forward progress. 
(09:03) So, first, just want to underscore the importance  of having that vision and that perspective on if   you and your team do your job correctly  what does the world look like? In terms   of crafting a compelling vision, I think that  there's sort of a few aspects. The first is   that you cannot go into a vacuum and come out  with a compelling vision that does not exist.  
(09:30) You have to be fundamentally inseparable from your  users, and also, fundamentally inseparable from   your team. And so, I think that there is sort of  this important cross-pollination of functions that   is really important in crafting a compelling  vision. You want to always ensure that there   are research insights that help you feel what a  user is feeling.
(10:00) You want to ensure that there   are beautiful designs and prototypes that help  communicate what this future world looks like,   and you also want to root it in engineering and  feasibility. And you want to be constantly, even   in the vision phase, assuring that what you're  marching after is something that is achievable   and something that you can work towards.
(10:23) And so, I think a lot of folks when they   think about visioning, they kind of think  about, "Okay, how do we start from scratch   and learn about the user and then translate  that into designs and then translate that   into engineering?" And it becomes this very  almost linear process. And I think that to the   extent that you can have this cross-pollination of  ideas and people working together, that leads to a   really strong vision.
(10:47) And there's this book that  I love called The Medici Effect, which basically   talks about how when people come from different  places and you have that confluence of ideas,   that leads to innovation at the end of the day. The second piece is, okay, once you have your   vision, once you have talked to your users and  built up your perspective and things like that,   it's like how do you communicate it internally  and how do you help everyone around you see what   you're seeing? And I think something that's really  unique about Figma is that it is a fundamentally  
(11:15) very, very detail-oriented culture. And it's  also a company that very much practices what   it preaches in terms of the future being  visual communication. And so, I've found   that words will only get you so far. So, when  I put together a vision with my team at Figma,   it's all about not just your traditional,  "Okay, here are pain points.
(11:42) And then,   here are solutions. And then, here is the timeline  and costing." But rather how can you bring all of   those things together and how can a vision pitch  effectively be pain point, solution, proof point,   pain point solution proof point? Because at the end of the day,   simply describing a product idea in words  is not as compelling as seeing a testimonial   from a user on top of a prototype or a  mock, and really feeling the pain points.
(12:13) Is there an example that we could talk about?  I know you can't talk about the product you're   working on yet, but from the past of a  vision that you crafted maybe to share   what the vision was or how you came  to that to make this even more real? So, before I was working on the new  product, I was working on the FigJam team,   and I was an early member of the FigJam team.
(12:40) And  whiteboarding was something that really took off   during the pandemic because it was the first  time that people were not together in office,   couldn't jam together, couldn't just throw up  a whiteboard behind them physically. And so,   there was kind of this question of, okay, how  do you combat these disparate teammates and   pull them together into a common space? And I  think that when we think about FigJam and what   success might look like for FigJam, a part  of it that I was really invested in was the   meetings experience. And specifically, what the  world would look like if we were successful at  
(13:20) bringing people together into a common space? And one of the early insights was, okay,   what is the most common meeting that takes place  in a FigJam file? It's a brainstorm, right? It's   like you have a bunch of people, you've coming  together and they're dropping a bunch of stickies   and stuff like that.
(13:43) And so, you have this proof  point of an activity that works really well inside   of a FigJam file. But then, at the same time,  something that's really interesting about FigJam,   people often ask, "Oh, you guys are Figma. How do  you guys use Figma as a company?" And it's kind of   interesting because I feel like we use Figma the  way that everyone uses Figma, but we use FigJam on   steroids. Every single activity in this company is  done in FigJam.
(14:05) Our product reviews are in there,   our Gantt charts are in there, our bug bashes  are in there. Every single thing is in FigJam.  And there was this gap between the way that  we were using FigJam as a company and the   way that the rest of the world was using  it, but brainstorms were working. And so,   you kind of think, "Okay, what's unique about  a brainstorm?" And you talk to your users and   you're like, "Why does a brainstorm make  so much more sense in a FigJam file than   anything else?" And what it comes down to is  brainstorms are this incredibly democratizing  
(14:32) process. It's this process where ideas can come  from anywhere, where it's not the loudest or the   most important person in the room who's doing  the talking, but it's everyone altogether. And   you're able to elicit reactions from people  who are more quiet in a meeting or people   who may prefer to ideate on their own before  coming out to everyone and things like that. 
(14:53) And so, we started with the seed of brainstorms  being this highly democratic process.   And what you see is that in most other scenarios,  meetings are very one way. You have one person   talking, and everyone else reacting. This is true  of a team kickoff. This is true of an all-hands.   This is true of basically every sort of scenario.
(15:23)   And so, what we fundamentally started marching   towards was how can we create this world where  the generative nature of a brainstorm is basically   the norm in other kinds of meetings. Where a team  kickoff is not just a PM and a designer handing   mocks to an engineer, but it's everyone  leaving stickies and everyone commenting   a
(15:47) t the same time, or everyone leaving... We have this ritual called Kudos Boards   inside of FigJam, where everyone will shower  each other with love and just kind call out   their teammates for what they've done over the  last week or so. And so how can we ensure that   those kind of rituals are in our templates  and that we're teaching people how to take   any meeting and make it more democratic? And  then, you anchor on this vision around, okay,   what does a more democratic workplace look like  and how can we get people to anchor around that   and how can we get people to get into the flow?  So, then we started launching features like music,  
(16:16) like voting, that really help you get into  flow when you're in that pile together. That is such a cool example. I'm trying to be  this archeologist studying what you're describing   and breaking it apart. So, what I'm hearing  essentially is there's this insight that you find   of, "Oh, here's a way we should think about the  way future of work.
(16:37) It should be more democratic,"   building on this idea of brainstorming, which  is one of the most inspiring ways of working   where it's not just someone sitting in a silo.  And then, you take that and create kind of a,   "Here's what the world could look like if  we could make everything this feel this way,   very democratic.
(16:56) " And then there's this pitch  that you eventually make of, "Here's the   product." And you talked about how the way you  pitch it is, "Here's a pain, here's a solution,   and here's a proof point of that solution,"  could be a testimonial or some data, I imagine. Definitely.
(17:11) I think that when you're actually  presenting a vision, one of the most important   things is that there is a single artifact  that the team is creating together. So, I   think a common occurrence is to have the research  readout, followed by the design crit, followed by   the product review. And that's fine, that works  in a lot of instances, but then you have every   team member thinking that their own deliverable  is what they need to pour all their energy into.  
(17:37) And what you actually want is for everyone to feel  incredible ownership and incredible passion about   this combined deliverable, so that it's a unified  team who believes a singular set of insights. So, what's an example of that?  Is it like a deck in Figma? Yeah, exactly.
(18:00) So, we often make our  decks in Figma, and I think that we   lean heavily into designing and prototyping  even before a project gets a green light. So,   I think that's something that's really unique  about Figma is normally you will talk about the   market space or the opportunity of the sizing, and  then decide to invest. Versus Figma is very much   a see to believe and see to feel that emotional  pull towards this is something worth investing in.
(18:25) Got it. So, that's what I was trying to get to  is how do you actually deliver a vision? So,   a lot of people, " Here, I need to create a  vision. I'm going to write out a paragraph   or a memo describing it." You can create mock-ups.
(18:38)   The way you're describing it, essentially, is make   it as real as possible, not just mocks, but  actual prototypes potentially. Many people   don't have design skills or designers on their  team or engineering skills to build a prototype.   Is there anything you can share for how to  do this where you don't have those skills? Yeah. Well, the good thing is that  with AI, it's getting way easier.
(19:00) So- True. A couple of weeks ago, Cognition launched, which  for those who don't know, is a startup that made   this AI agent called Devin, which can code  anything for you, supposedly. It definitely   took Twitter by storm and got me super stoked.  And so, I think something that's interesting   about the current AI revolution is that it's very  much lowering the floor to starting out and to   building something. And so, recently, I was doing  a chat with David Huang from Replit, and he's the  
(19:36) head of marketing and design at Replit. And he was  basically talking about how if Replit does their   job right, you start seeing it as your technical  co-founder. And I think, conversely at Figma we   kind of think about if we're doing our job, maybe  in the future people will think about Figma as   their designer co-founder, where you can go in and  use it to start bringing things into existence. 
(20:03) So, I think one is, yeah, I do think  that we're just trending in a direction,   and this was not true a year ago, where the floor  to building something is just so much lower. So,   that's one piece. I think the second piece is just  go around and ask people. And so, for example, for   the project that I'm currently working on, I used  a hackathon to pitch it.
(20:32) And basically, I built   conviction in the idea many months before the  hackathon, and I was verbally pitching it. And it   was kind of like, "Oh yeah, maybe at some point in  the future we would make an investment like this."  But what actually ended up happening was  we have this concept called Maker Week,   which is our internal hackathon, where the entire  company goes on pause for a week.
(20:52) And I think that   most people think that, "Oh, hackathons are only  a time for engineers to build." And I think that   that's one of the biggest mistakes ever. I think  that anyone can have an idea and can... Literally,   what I did was walk around the New York office  asking every single person, "Will you work on   this thing with me?" And eventually, someone says  yes, and then you can use that to build momentum,   grow the team, and build something great. But  I think that never letting your own skills stop  
(21:21) you from going out there making a pitch and then  turning that into reality is really important. I love both of these points and pieces of  advice. I feel like I always say that if a   PM has a designer partner that can just  help them with a deck or help them with   ideas, that you're such a superpower, everything  just looks so much more interesting when you have   a designer helping you craft your idea. And the  way you describe it is pretty simple.
(21:44) Just go ask   people for help because you're probably going  to find someone that's going to help you out.  You mentioned conviction, so that's a great  segue to else where I wanted to go next. So,   I asked Yuhki, chief product officer at  Figma, about your strengths. And he told me   that you get extremely strong conviction  extremely quickly.
(22:06) He said that this strong   conviction allows you to navigate the messy  journey from zero to one and rally your team   in a really powerful way. He actually  wanted me to ask you this very question,   how do you get to this strong conviction? And  how much of it is to true deep conviction,   versus there's an inkling of instinct that this  is going to work and then you profit on the sense   of conviction to get people rallying behind  you and to kind of take this leap of faith? I think that one of the most important things for  a PM to create for their team is momentum. You  
(22:39) have to constantly be creating forward progress,  probably towards that vision that we were just   talking about. But I'm a huge proponent of Jeff  Bezos's one-way doors, two-way doors framework.   And I think that especially in a software company,  most things are two-way doors. You can come back.  
(23:00) And so, it's so important to have an opinion and  use that opinion to anchor people around and have   people react to. So, I used to work at Meta before  I worked at Figma, and Meta basically distilled   the product role into two core capabilities.  One was product sense and one was execution.   And when you think about product sense, it's like,  okay, what is product sense? It's like a really   abstract term. And at the end of the day, I think  product sense is just having good intuition. 
(23:34) And so, there's this question about, okay, how  do you build up intuition? And I think that it's   just by having this insatiable curiosity and  talking to users at every chance you get. So,   I would go to dinners and grill the people around  me on how they use Figma and how they use FigJam.  
(23:52) And I think when you have a conversation with  someone, it's so much more powerful in terms   of getting those anecdotes to stick in your  head. And what actually happens is once you   start having enough conversations, let's say you  start with conversations ABC, then you progress   to conversations DEF, over time you build this  almost repository or library of conversations   that you can draw from as you're making product  decisions.
(24:17) And so, I think that that's a really   powerful thing to lean into as you're thinking  about, "Okay, which path do we go down?"  Now, there's the question of in the absence  of any external signal, what can you do? And   I think that a very common thing, especially for  PMs who are younger in their career, is to think   that your opinion isn't right or might not be  reflective of what the user thinks.
(24:44) So, you think,   "Okay, I believe this," and at the end of the day,  everyone has an opinion, right? So, "I think this,   but what do I know compared to these people  who've been in my company for 10 years?" Or,   "What do I know compared to my users who are using  the product?" And so, then I think what might   happen in those instances is you kind of start  from nothing, you start from zero and you're like,   "Okay, I'm going to build up from zero and gather  all of these insights to get to a good place." 
(25:12) And I think my take is that putting out  an idea, even if it's totally wrong,   is a much better catalyst for getting to a  good solution because people are much more   likely to react to an idea than to nothing. So,  if it's the right idea, then they'll be like,   "Oh my God, yes, let's totally do that.
(25:36) "  And if it's wrong, then it's like, okay,   then they will take you in a different direction  and you end up with something that's probably   much more opinionated than if you hadn't put  anything out there. And so, it was funny,   one piece of advice that I got from Yuhki when I  was working on my vision sprint was like, "Okay,   when you go into research, you want to go in  with something that's at least an A- idea, or   you think is at least an A- idea.
(25:58) Because if you  talk to users and you learn something about it,   that's awesome. Get to an A+. If not, at least  you're not at a B." And so, I think that having- If not, at least you're not at a B. And so  I think that having that early conviction,   being willing to communicate it, being willing  to get feedback from other folks in your team,   have them react to it, then get users  to react to it, is so important,   but then also something that's equally important  when you have "high conviction", quote, unquote,   is to be willing to kill your darlings if you  hear something that tells you otherwise. You  
(26:26) need to be so sort of strong opinions weekly  held. And if you get external signal that's   telling you something different, you should be  ready to pivot and have that agility to do so. There's a lot of PMs that kind of worry about  having too strong of an opinion and being like,   "Here's what we're doing," because  then there's this like, "Oh, okay,   they just want us to do the thing they want us  to do, and we don't have a voice.
(26:48) We don't have   a chance to influence." It seems like you find a  really magical balance of strong opinion of like,   "Here's what we should be doing," but people  still love working with you and don't feel   like... I haven't heard like, "Oh, she just tells  us what to bill.
(27:03) " What advice do you have there   of just finding that balance and making it  clear? It's just my idea. We can change it. I would say that speaking about weaknesses,  having such strong conviction absolutely has   downsides. In particular, it's possible that it  doesn't have the desired effect. So for example,   my designer who I work with, his name is Kean,  he's so talented. We work like this.
(27:28) Literally for   most of last year, we had an hour long one- on-one  every single day and still that wasn't enough- Everyday? ... meeting time. Yes. We basically work together  like this, but he also told me that when I joined   the company, he was like, "Who is this girl and  why does she have so many opinions?" And so I   think that something that I have learned to do  over time, and I think that's something that's   a good sort of thing to lean into if you are a  PM who has strong opinions, is to be very direct  
(27:55) about how much you care about your opinions. So  now, I'll do this thing where I'll be like, "Oh,   I think we should do this, but I feel like medium  confidence on it." So if you feel stronger like,   "I defer to you," and always being very, very,  very explicit about like, "I feel really strongly   about this," or, "This is my hypothesis," or,  "I do not have an opinion here. I defer to you.
(28:21) "  I think the second thing that I would mention that  is really important in order to do this correctly   is... So I have a very direct communication style.  I will never sugarcoat anything. I'll never say I   like something if I don't like something.
(28:36) If I'm  in a meeting and someone tells me they don't agree   with me, I will tell them I don't agree with  them back. In return, I really like it when   people are very direct with me. And so I think  that whenever I join a team or whenever I start   working with a new person, I always let them  know. I'm always like, :I am very direct and   if you disagree with me, I want to know that.
(28:58) " Because I think sometimes what can happen is   really strongly minded PMs can go into  a conversation and can be like, "Oh,   I think we should do X," even though they actually  feel medium confidence about X. And then the rest   of the room is like, "Oh, my God. That PM feels  so strongly about doing X that I'm not going to   say anything because they clearly have so much  conviction in X.
(29:18) " And what you actually want   is for everyone to feel comfortable speaking up.  And so creating that culture where everyone feels   comfortable giving their opinion and communicating  their level of confidence is really important. So this direct communication point you made,  somebody shared this quote, Alice Ching,   who I think your EM said this about you  that she's in awe of how direct you are,   especially how you can make it not personal  and help people focus on the matter at hand.  
(29:43) Any other advice you have there for people to,  one, either be more direct and successful in   that being directness? Or is there an example you  can share where, because I think people hear this,   they're like, "Oh yeah, I'm going to be direct.
(29:57)   I'm going to be so direct, it's going to be   great," and then it's so hard to actually do,  so is there maybe an example that comes to mind   of here's something you did recently of like,  "Oh, wow. Okay, I see what she's talking about"? So I think that directness only works  if it's two-way. If it is one person   being really direct with another person and  then the other person being afraid to talk,   you will end up in probably a not great  relationship where communication is only   going one way and both people will be in their  own head. The person being direct will be like,  
(30:31) "Why is the other person not responding to my  feedback?" And then the other person will be like,   "Why am I the only one getting so much feedback?"  Meta, where I used to work, had this phrase,   "Feedback as a gift," and I so deeply believe  in this.
(30:49) And in order to really lean into that   phrase and really embody it, I think it's really  important that feedback is this constantly flowing   thing, not something that happens once or twice  a year when you have an official feedback cycle.  And the way that I try and create this  culture of constant direct communication,   constant feedback is if you have feedback to give  someone else, I think you can start by asking,   "Hey, do you have feedback from me?" And  kind of taking the feedback first so then   that person feels like, "Okay, maybe I have my way  of seeing this situation. Let me communicate that  
(31:21) and get off my chest." And then when you give your  feedback, it's sort of even. And then feedback in   my opinion is something that you should always  act on. So then to the extent that you can as   soon as possible put that into effect and be  like, "Okay, I'm hearing this.
(31:36) I'm going to do   XYZ in order to combat that." I think then that  incentivizes the other person to do the same. Okay, let me quickly summarize what we've gone  through so far in our archaeological study,   and then I'm going to drill into a specific  trait. So one is just having a really powerful   vision that people get really excited about.
(31:57)   And the way you described it is kind of find an   insight about how you think people could be, in  this example, how people could be working maybe   through this brainstorm approach and then kind of  expanding that into something where this is what   would happen if we achieve this in the future,  and this is what the world could look like, and   that's something people get really excited about.
(32:13) So kind of creating compelling vision, being able   to communicate it with, and in your experience,  communicating with prototypes and mocks is the   way that you find it to be most effective. Also,  just getting to strong conviction, whether it's   real or not, but it sounds like it's actually very  genuine about an idea and making it clear.
(32:28) You're   very excited about this and here's how it's going  to be amazing for the business and the company,   and here's why you should be excited about  it. Also, you talked about being very   direct and being very honest and basically  radical candor as some people describe it.   First of all, is there anything else I missed  specifically before I drill into one of these? That sounds right.
(32:49) Okay, cool. So kind of along these lines,  something else that came up a bunch of in   my emails with folks that you work with  is how you build hype really effectively,   and you talked about this a bit of just creating  momentum about an idea. So you got this idea,   get everyone pitch it, get everyone excited,  and then it just continues to build hype and   momentum.
(33:13) So a quote from Karl Jiang,  who is on your team maybe, he said,   "I feel no PM has ever got me so hyped about  a feature." And Yuhki said that you overcome   people's doubts by building hype and hacking  hype is the way described it. Talk about this   and why do you think it's important and  how you actually go about doing this. When you are spearheading an idea or a product,  it's really on you to have a pulse on how everyone   else is feeling about that product.
(33:53) And different  products need different levels of excitement   to make it out the door. If there is something  that leadership has really strong conviction in,   it's important for leadership to amp the whole  company up behind that vision. On the flip side,   if you yourself are pushing a zero to one  idea from the bottoms up, the onus is even   more on you to make sure that that project and  that product is constantly propped up and that   people are excited about it to make it out  the door.
(34:25) And so one example is we've been   talking about this product that I'm working  on. And coming out of winter break this year,   there's this sense, or at least I always suspect,  that there's this sense of over winter break,   everyone forgets what happened last year. It  goes at the door because you were hopefully   doing something that took your mind off work.
(34:46) And so at the same time, there's this sense of   how do you create forward momentum inside of a  company in January when people are slowly coming   back into office, everyone's trickling back in  at different dates because everyone to click   slightly different PTO, how do you rally people  in a certain direction? And so we have this thing   at Figma called SKO or Sales Kickoff, which is  every year the sales team comes together, and   we have a keynote and a set of fireside chats and  stuff like that, and we talk about what's coming   for the year. And at this point, our product, it  existed, but it was absolutely barely built. It  
(35:26) was rough around the edges. It had bugs every  day. Maybe 10 people in the company were using   it and something like that outside of the team. Yeah, it was so important to me that this product   got visibility in this forum because this was the  first company-wide forum of the year where we were   declaring priorities for the year.
(35:55) And so it was  so important to me that this product had some sort   of a moment, or speaking of show, don't tell, a  demo in the context of this keynote. And so Kris,   our CTO and Yuhki, our CPO, were giving  this keynote on what does our year look   like? And I really, really deeply insisted that  we should include a demo. And I think what ended   up happening is something like that, a demo that  wasn't meant to be a demo or that people weren't   expecting does so much in terms of driving that  sense of hype and helping people see what you   yourself see in the future. And what's really  interesting is I think that hype is something  
(36:39) that... You can't really create hype for something  you don't believe in my opinion. The only way to   create hype is to get people to see what you see. And so I think that it's incredibly important to   leverage very large forums like that Maker  Week, like Sales Kickoff.
(37:04) We have CONFIG,   which is our annual showcase to the world of what  we're working on in order to get everyone to see   what you're seeing and to be really scrappy about  it and to really be the person who's pushing your   product to its limits in the right moments.
(37:21) And  I think what you find is that if you push your   product to get visibility, maybe even beyond what  the current stage of product development merits   is that you have really incredible learnings  because the more that you can put your product   in front of people and get them to use it, the  more signal you get on how it's trending. And so   what ended up happening was something that could  have originally been perceived as a distraction   to the team actually ended up being something  that added so much fuel to the fire in terms of,   one, giving us product insights to inform  our next steps. And two, getting the entire  
(37:52) company to feel truly, deeply feel excited  about getting this thing out the door. And this pitch and product you're describing is   the one that's going to be launching  this mysterious new product, right? Yes. I feel like we're going to build so much hype for  this thing when it ever comes out.
(38:09) I'm so excited   to learn what it is. Coming back to the point,  so what I'm hearing essentially is you find it's   important to take responsibility for this thing  to become a thing at a company. A lot of people   have an idea, they build a prototype, they build  a hackathon project, and then they're like, "God,   no one's ever doing anything with it. It's not  going anywhere. Nothing ever happens.
(38:27) " What I'm   hearing is it's on you to get people excited  about it and find these opportunities to get   people excited about it. And there's also this,  what I'm feeling is the feels is really important.   It's like you have all the data probably.
(38:41) There's  probably a logical case for this that you've made   across the company, but what you're describing  here is you need to get people hyped about it   in a emotional, visceral way and basically find  opportunities to do that is kind of a lesson here. In my mind, there is internal hype, which is  how do you get buy-in and everyone inside of   the company to be fanging their fist on  the table for a product to get built,   but there's also external hype, which is like how  do you get your users hyped about your product?   How do you get them to really be so stoked  when there are milestone occasions for your  
(39:16) product or milestone launches and for them to  be celebrating with you? And one of the things   that I loved the most when I joined the company  was Figma and design Twitter have had this very   symbiotic relationship where each has grown  with the other over time. And what really   happens is anytime we launch something, you  have all of design Twitter celebrating with us. 
(39:39) And one other moment when I thought it was very  fun to drive hype was when I worked on FigJam   in 2022. It was the one year FigJam anniversary  in April, and project anniversaries or product   anniversaries are quite an exciting milestone  within the company. You bring everyone together,   maybe you pop a bottle of champagne, you kind  of celebrate how far you've come and what all   you've learned since the launch.
(40:13) But we were  really thinking like, "Okay, FigJam is awesome,   but FigJam isn't just any product. Figjam has  a personality. FigJam is cheeky. FigJam is   fun. FigJam has this cute skeuomorphism going on  where you feel like it's your friend. And so okay,   how would you celebrate that moment for a friend?"  You wouldn't really have an anniversary party.
(40:32) You   would throw it a full on birthday party. And so what we basically did was at the   one year anniversary of FigJam, I worked with the  marketing team and our engineering team in order   to basically kick off a mini launch inside of the  product of a bunch of new features. And what we   did was we Easter egged them through the product  and each sort of product that we were releasing   inside of FigJam was hidden under this little  birthday present.
(41:05) And throughout the day,   we sent all of our users on an Easter egg hunt of  presents inside of FigJam. And so not only was a   FigJam getting the presents, but it was our users  getting the presents. I think that hype as well   is really tied to emotion. So to the extent  that a person using a product can feel like,   "Oh, this thing that is built in the product  was built for me not to advance the company's   goals or anything like that, but to make  me feel special, to make me feel happy.
(41:34) "  I think that's a really key instrument in driving  hype as well. And I think that something that's   quite interesting about hype and getting your  users to feel strongly about your product is   that every product has their own brand of delight  or excitement or energy. So hype for FigJam is   incredibly different than hype from Figma, where  hype for Figma might be this really, really niche   design capability that unlocks this pain point  that designers have been having for years and   years. And then hype for Apple might be like the  world's best unboxing experience or something like  
(42:08) that. And so leaning into a product's brand in  order to figure out what is the optimal way to   generate hype with your audience and form that  connection is something that's really important. I love that example.
(42:25) Something else I'm finding as  a thread throughout all of the lessons and stories   he shares is just an immersion in your user base  and truly knowing what they're excited about,   what problems they have, and you talk about having  strong conviction and painting a grand vision.   It's one thing if someone that doesn't do that  does that, it's just like, why would I believe   them? Versus someone that like you, where you're  just constantly talking to users and actually   understand what they need. So I guess the question  here is just what advice would you share with  
(42:53) folks to build that, to be immersed with users?  What do you actually do? How do you actually do   that? Are you just organizing meetings, events?  Are you scheduling chats? How do you do this? Yeah, so I think it honestly depends on the  product. So when I worked at Meta, it was so   easy.
(43:15) Everyone and their mom had opinion about  the product, which was really great because it   meant that anyone you met, you could kind of ask  them what they liked, what they didn't like. You   can relay that through the company, et cetera. Now  at Figma, we have a slightly more niche audience.   I think that hopefully, ultimately we get  to everyone. We started with design teams,   now we're thinking about the entire product  development cycle and how we can build for that,   and then who knows, beyond that could be anything.
(43:46)   But I think that constantly immersing yourself in   those circles where your users are is really  important. So for me, it's like anytime that   I'm catching up with a friend, who mildly works in  tech or a tech adjacent field, I will generally be   asking them about Figma.
(44:08) And I think what's really  great is that as a company scales over time, their   user base gets broader and broader. And so when  we grew from a single product company with Figma   into now a multi product company with FigJam, dev  mode, etc, our audience exploded. And we already   saw latent behavior inside of Figma, but now it's  even more clear how wide reaching the product is.  
(44:30) And so something that I find incredibly useful is  to not just ask users of your product what they   think about your product, but to ask non-users  about your product, why they're not using your   product.
(44:49) And actually I think that those are the  most insightful conversations because I think that   having a product shine and having a product do  well and have great adoption isn't just about the   product being great. It's also about the marketing  and the perceptions that surround the product and   p
(45:04) otentially the hype that surrounds that, right? And so having those conversations about... I   remember having an early conversation with  folks from my previous team about, "Hey,   are you guys using FigJam?" And they would  be like, "Maybe sometimes." And I'd be like,   "Well, why aren't you using FigJam? It's literally  built for you.
(45:20) " And then that led to a series of   product insights that led us to invest in a set  of features that would make it much easier for a   non-designer to get started out on the canvas. So  we launched this kind of placeholder experience   that rather than traditional templates, really let  people see the various use cases and preview the   various use cases on the canvas. And so that was  incredibly important.
(45:41) And then Figma, of course,   is kind of like it's in this pro-sumer space  where it's like you talk to anyone in tech and   maybe they're your top total addressable market. But then there are some products I know that   people work on which are very removed from  the average person, you have infra products,   security products and things like that, where  you can't just walk up to someone and have a   conversation with them about why aren't they using  your product because that conversation might not   make any sense. And so in those instances,  I think that what's really important is it  
(46:13) depends on the stage of company that you're  at. If you're at an early stage company,   you need to be the one going out there and having  conversations with your users and just literally   looking up your users through whatever channels  necessary and figuring out how you can connect   with them.
(46:33) I think this is also why founder market  fit at startups is so important is because to the   extent that you can use yourself as a limits test  for what user needs there are, that helps you move   really fast in the product development cycle. And then if you're on the larger side, I think   that having a really tight relationship with your  sales team is really important. And basically,   just being on sales calls because you want to be  in a situation where the customer pain points on   sales calls are cross pollinating into the product  roadmap, and you also want to ensure that your  
(47:02) sales team has visibility into what might be  coming and are constantly informing that. And   so I think really leaning into that, building  that relationship between these traditionally   more siloed orgs and hopping on those calls  is something that I'd really recommend. Awesome. Let's go actually one layer deeper  here.
(47:21) So you're talking to people all the   time about FigJam, "Aren't you using FigJam?  What do you think of Figma? What do think of   this?" You're hopping on sales calls. What  do you do with what you hear? Is there kind   of an operational approach where you... Do you  just put in your head and sticks in your head   and rolls around and comes up, things emerge?  Do you have a place you put these insights,   you're learning? Are you putting post-its in  FigJam, for example.
(47:42) And then on the sales side,   do you have a cadence where I'm going to join a  sales call once a week, here's a person I love   in sales, I'm going to try to join all the calls.  How do you actually operationalize these things? The insights get operationalized in a  number of ways. So first is... So yeah,   let's continue using FigJam as an example.
(48:02) I  think, like I mentioned, Figma as a company   uses FigJam for everything. Multiple FigJam files  are made per day, per meeting, et cetera. We had   this initial situation where people outside  of the company were mostly using FigJam for   brainstorms. And so as we were scaling our FigJam  sales team, I sort of set up a recurring cadence   with the folks in our sales team in order  to understand like, "Okay, what are you guys   hearing?" And then I would share what was coming,  and then I would use their input as signal as to   what should be prioritized or deprioritized  on the roadmap. And they would use my signal  
(48:41) to understand what were the various use cases  that they could be pushing with the customers.  And one thing that happened during one of the  meetings was I literally walked them through,   this meeting, this is how I use FigJam. In  this meeting, this is how I use FigJam. In this   meeting, this is how I use FigJam, blah, blah,  blah.
(48:59) And what that resulted in was I actually   made a Loom video walking through my weekend  FigJam, that our sales team later distributed   to a bunch of companies to inspire them as to  like, "Hey, not only can you use FigJam for this,   you can use Fig Jam for X, Y, Z. You can use it  for your team pickups. You can use it for your   retros. You can use it for planning your mom's  birthday party.
(49:22) You can use it for planning your   all hands. You can use it for sketching out the  contents of what's going to go into your next   deck," so on and so forth. And so it basically  manifests in two way, the first is having it   inform the prioritization of your product roadmap. And then the second is what ideally creating   artifacts that the sales team can use to  evangelize the things that you are seeing   and the stepping stones to that vision that  you creating.
(49:48) And then the last thing is that   sometimes the conversations aren't immediately  actionable, right? Sometimes the sales team has an   insight or has a request that is just objectively  not feasible because the team has too much on its   plate.
(50:05) Conversely, sometimes the team might have  a suggestion for something that might be pitched   to sales folks that's too early given the stage  of the conversation. And for that, we basically   have... We store it in Asana basically. We have  this integration, which many companies might have,   which is like Slack integration, where  you can react with an Asana emoji,   and then any piece of feedback that comes in  from sales or from the rest of the company   gets turned into a task in your backlog,  and then you do a weekly grooming of that.
(50:33) Amazing. Cool. Very tactical and useful. This episode is brought to you by Vanta.   When it comes to ensuring your company  has top-notch security practices,   things get complicated fast.

Another thread that I've noticed, and I wasn't   planning to go in this direction, but you just  care so deeply about the things you work on. You   actually really, really love it and want it to  be incredibly successful and feels like you're   just always thinking about it.
(51:45) Reminding  me of this quote from your colleague Karl,   they shared that, "It feels like you care deeply,  which makes me care deeply. Who wants to be led   by someone who doesn't care about what they're  building?" It feels like that's an important   part of the way you work and think. Is  there anything you want to say about that? When I started out my product career, I actually- ... About that.
(52:04) When I started out my product career, I actually  joined as a RPM, or rotational product manager,   at Meta, which was effectively a program that  brought together new grad PMs, so people who   had zero PM experience and taught them how to  be PMs. And, in the beginning of this program,   we had a series of conversations with leaders  across the company.
(52:26) And, one particularly notable   conversation was with Julie Zhu, who was the first  ever intern at Meta and the VP of design. And,   she was giving us feedback and advice about how  to draft compelling product strategy, etc. And,   something she said that has stuck with me  throughout my entire product career is that when   two people disagree about product strategy, it is  because they have different assumptions.
(52:56) Because,   if you have the same assumptions, there  is no reason why a person should think,   "We should do X versus we should do Y." And so,  it's like, "Okay, how does this relate to what   you were just asking about feeling deeply  and caring about what you're building?"  I think that it's really important to not just  build a roadmap because it's handed to you,   or not just build an idea because it's handed  to you.
(53:25) I think that you need to understand in   the event that it's a top-down strategy, what  are the assumptions that led to folks believing   that that is the right idea? And then, if  it is you pushing something bottoms up,   you need to be able to ensure that everyone  else has the same assumptions that you have in   your head that leads them to believe deeply  or not believe deeply.
(53:45) And I think what's   really important is that people can, to Carl's  point, gauge someone is about a project. And,   my take is that, the more you believe in an idea,  the more natural it is to be passionate about it. I imagine people listening to this will feel  like, "Oh shit, I don't really love what I'm   working on. I don't work at Figma. I don't have  the best of most amazing products.
(54:11) " Maybe it's   hard to get excited about stuff. Is there anything  you could share there? Just say you're working   on something that you're not so passionate  about, is it a fine thing, keep searching,   or is it just figure out something you're excited  about? Any advice there for someone in that boat? My first piece of advice would be to not just  think about the scope of what you are working on   as the thing that happens to be in flight at any  given moment. But, if you're working in a company,  
(54:42) take a step back, understand the vision of  that company, and understand your users,   and understand if there's anything in that space  that you are passionate about. I think it's quite   easy to believe that the project that you're  working on is your scope. My take is that your   scope is the world, and to the extent that you can  figure out does the idea that you're passionate   about fall within your company, versus fall  outside of your company, that should guide the   next steps in your career. And so, I think that  potentially common misconception is that founding  
(55:25) something is just for capital F founders, but I  think that anyone can found something. You can   found something inside of an existing company, you  can found something from scratch. And, there are   different reasons why you would do each, right? The reasons why you would found inside of an   existing company is if you think that there is  a distribution advantage that you want to take   advantage of, if there is a technical or platform  advantage that you want to take advantage of.
(55:57) Or,   there's also a reality which is it's slightly less  risk. So, depending on what your risk tolerance   is, you can figure out what makes sense. There  are things that are harder inside of an existing   company, right? It's harder to take an executive  decision.
(56:13) You actually cannot take an executive   decision. You need to receive buy-in on every  single decision that you make. Sometimes it's   harder to move faster. And then sometimes,  there are things that are just different   when you're starting inside of an existing  company, versus starting something outright.  So the things that are different is building a  team is quite different.
(56:33) The way that you recruit   and the set of folks that you can recruit from,  that composition is quite different. And then,   the way that you pitch and who you are  pitching to is quite different. And so,   I think that sometimes, yeah, it makes sense to  found inside of a company and to use that to make   your flame burn, right? Sometimes it makes sense  to found outright.
(56:55) But I think that the first key   to being passionate about what you're working on  is to find an idea that you're passionate about. I love this as a metaphor of the flame where  it applies both to you as a person at a company   and keeping that flame going and building it.
(57:09) And  then also the idea and a project that accompanies   little flame that you're growing over time,  building momentum around. So you've hinted   at this whole idea of starting zero to one and  building new products within larger companies,   which I want to get to. We've gone really  deep on a bunch of awesome stuff and I'm   really happy we did. There's four more skills  of things you're amazing at.
(57:27) So here's an idea,   let me share the four. How about you pick two  that you're most passionate about that you think   you have the most advice to share, and then we'll  just do those, and then we'll go to what you've   learned about building something completely  new at a larger company? How does that sound? Perfect.
(57:42) Okay. So, from folks that you work with, the  four other skills, things you're amazing at,   and I still want to hear the things you think  you're not amazing at. One is creativity, that you   have really creative solutions to problems. Two is  empathy.
(57:57) You're really strong at empathizing with   users and using that to build amazing products.  Three is culture. Sho tells me you're the culture   carrier at Figma, which is amazing, because  the culture there from what I hear is amazing.   And then, four is dealing with change. You're  amazing at just like, "Okay, cool. Priorities   are changing. Great, let's go. Here we go.
(58:21) "  Which of those two feel most interesting to you? Maybe we can do the latter two, because they're a   little bit different than the other  things we've been discussing. Yeah. Sounds great. So, I guess culture. Let me start  there. Okay, so yeah, Sho called you the culture   carrier Figma. I hear there's some fun things  you all do there.
(58:37) There's something called the   hot seat, there's something called the Figgies.  First of all, can you maybe explain these two   things? And then just broadly, what you find  is important about focusing on culture as a PM? Yeah, I can definitely talk about those two  things. So, hot seat is actually a tradition   I started at our first PM offsite post-pandemic.  So this was March of 2022.
(59:03) The PM team was sub-15   people at that point, and we all fit around a  dinner table, which is no longer true today. And,   it was really important to me that we all  got to know each other in a context that   was outside of work. I think that PMing  is a highly collaborative function. And,   to the extent that you have great relationships  with all the teams that you're interfacing with,   one is it goes a long way in terms of the  product, but two, speaking about passion,   it makes your day-to-day so much more fun if  you feel like you're working with your friends,  
(59:38) and if you are working with your friends. And so, we were coming out of a long intense   day session, and I was thinking about, "Okay,  how do we break the ice?" And, hot seat is   this game where you go around the table and each  person gets two minutes on the clock and everyone   else at the table can ask them anything. And if  they want to, they can decline to answer.
(1:00:00) But   we try and keep it, generally speaking, quite  friendly and comfortable for folks. And so,   we kicked off this game. And, what was really  interesting was earlier that day we had done a   personality test, as a side note, our PM  team is obsessed with personality tests. Which personality test, by the way? We to this day say the best one was the one that  we did at this offsite, which is the Strengths   Finder test. And, what had basically happened was  over the course of that morning, we had all dug  
(1:00:31) into... We were saying, "What are our strengths?  What are our weaknesses?" Etc. And we had this   really fun foundation to build on during the game  of hot seat, where it was like, we were digging   into like, "What about people's backgrounds made  them think the way that they do today? And, what   random anecdote at age seven of playing catch with  their dad in the field led to how they thought   about auto layout? Blah, blah, blah, blah." And, I  think that being able to understand what motivates  
(1:00:58) a person is so important when you're working with  them, and also just in building a connection with   them. And so, that was this moment that  really brought the whole team together.  Something that I was really gratified to hear  after is that, since then, hot seat has become a   tradition within the company. And so, all the PMs  went on to play it with their own teams.
(1:01:19) Yuki and   Sho went on to play it with the exec team, so on  and so forth. And so, it's become this thing that   now anytime that someone joins the team, okay,  you put them in the hot seat. And then, if you're   meeting someone's significant other, you put them  in the hot seat.
(1:01:34) And it's this thing that is just   totally spread, but it's a really fun way to  just get to know folks and what drives them. So,   that's one of my favorites. I highly recommend. The second thing that you asked about, which was   the Figgies. And, this is basically an Oscar style  awards ceremony that was hacked together.
(1:01:55) And so,   where the Figgies was inspired from was actually  every year we have... I was mentioning like SKO,   our sales kickoff. And, on the last night  of SKO, there's this award ceremony,   where they appreciate all of the incredible work  that has taken place in the sales and marketing   org. And I saw this and I was like, "This is  incredible.
(1:02:18) We should absolutely be celebrating   the product team as well when we're together."  And so, what I did was I basically took our   Figma boardroom, which is called Bigma, and  worked with another PM Elan to deck it out,   and a red carpet, gold curtains, etc. And we  bought little Oscar trophies for everyone,   and got their names written on it, and voted  people in for all of these absurd categories,   like most likely to name their child  Figma, most likely to go their career   without writing a PRD. Blah, blah, blah. And, of course, forced everyone to give some  
(1:02:59) acceptance speech. But, I think that making people  feel appreciated for even just the quirks and the   energy that they bring to the team is something  that's incredibly important. And celebrating that   diversity together is something that I think goes  a long way in terms of making people feel close,   and also making people understand maybe someone  who they don't know that well on the PM team,   because then you learn, "Okay, beyond them having  this Zoom background, this is what's cheeky about  
(1:03:29) them. Or this is what's interesting or unique  about them." And so, I think that culture is so   important. Figma has this core value called play,  which I love, which really emphasizes just that   everyone should be having fun at all times, and  work should be fun, and gathering should be fun.  
(1:03:49) And I think that I personally am a huge believer  in this remote first role that we live in,   you also want to take advantage of those times  when you're able to get together and do things   that make the team feel geographically close,  even when they're geographically spread out. Oh man, it's so fun.
(1:04:12) And I love  that it's just like, you did this,   right? It's not like Dylan is adding all these  rituals to the team. It's very bottom up. And,   in theory, any PM on the  team could have done this. It's interesting, something that I had  heard, Vishal Shah, who was the former   head of product at Instagram say, is that,  often in companies culture is set top down,   and then the innovation that comes  out of that is bottoms up.
(1:04:37) And so,   I think in the first place, having a value  like play does a lot in order to make folks   feel like these things are celebrated  and time should be carved out for them. To come back to your original point of just  culture is everything, a lot of PMs are like,   "I have so much work to do. I have so many  things to do.
(1:04:57) I'm just working all day every   day." What can you tell them about why this is so  important and worth putting some time into? And   should everybody? Or is it just like, "If you're  excited about this, do it. If not, don't worry"? I think culture is important in that it  establishes trust between groups of people.  
(1:05:13) And so, I think that actually earlier you were  asking about passion and what makes someone feel   passionate about work. And I think realistically,  that passion breaks down into two things. One is,   are you passionate about the vision that you're  building towards? Which we spoke about.
(1:05:32) But the   second thing is, are you passionate  about the people who you work with?  And, I think that roadmaps change, products  change, but feeling a connection to the folks that   you're working with make you much more durable  as a team. It means that when times get tough,   which they will, your gut instinct is to  rally together and collaborate together   to find a solution, rather than to jump ship or  something.
(1:06:01) I think personally, I'm in love with   my team. They give me so much joy and happiness  on a daily basis. I was telling them the other   day that when they post prototypes in our Slack  channel, sometimes I get little flutters in my   chest like when you have a crush on someone. And,  I think that having that emotional connection to   your team is fun. And I think that emotional  connection comes from investing in culture.
(1:06:26) And again, it's like, you did it. You made it  happen, right? It's not like, "Oh, this sucks.   My team's no fun." It's like, you can make it more  fun. And I think the two examples you shared are   awesome, because one is a high-end version where  there's a lot of work.
(1:06:39) And the hot seat, it's just   a quick idea that takes no work, just an idea,  and then you just ask to do it, and it's there. Okay, so actually, I want to combat the perception  that the Figgy's was a high production, high cost   thing. It was very low cost. I ordered everything  on Amazon and assembled it in an hour.
(1:06:55) And so,   there are ways to be scrappy in making  things come together. And so, I would say,   don't be intimidated by any idea of being  too large to take on. Just go for it. That's an awesome correction. Okay, final trait  you're great at. Somebody shared that you pivot   with grace and enthusiasm when things change  and priorities change, projects are killed,   projects are spun up.
(1:07:26) There's something that  a lot of people at companies just get so   sad about, "Oh my God, things keep changing. My  project's killed. Oh, this priority changed." It   feels like you've learned to make that  a superpower. What can you share about   what you've learned there and how to leverage  that into doing great and being successful? For this one, I could actually maybe give  an example that preceded my product career,   which was, when I was in college, I actually  founded a national design conference for   students across the country. And the way that  this came about was when I was in college,  
(1:07:59) design was very much having a watershed moment  in tech. So, companies like Airbnb and Pinterest   were leading an industry and they were leading  not just because they built technology and made   it accessible, but because they were really using  the interface layer to differentiate. So there was   this point where software had reached a certain  level of saturation, where things that were not   possible were now suddenly possible, and now  suddenly possible in multiple companies.
(1:08:30) And   design became this differentiator, which is really  exciting. But at the same time, none of this was   reflected in most schools across the country. And so, I went to Princeton and there was nothing   that resembled product design in our curriculum.  And this was baffling to me, because I was like,   &
(1:08:56) quot;There is such clear momentum..." Speaking about  momentum in industry about this being a profession   that is so important and so influential in  building the next generation of companies. Yet,   the groundwork to make that happen wasn't  really there. And then, I interned at Facebook,   and I realized that my entire class of 25 interns  had very similar experiences, where they too were   self-taught product designers.
(1:09:19) And so, that  summer, I actually watched a documentary that   was coincidentally produced by Envision that  featured folks like John Maeda, amongst others,   and was talking about how design changed the  world that we lived in, and was going to rewrite   the future, which I really believed in. And so, I  was incentivized to found this conference called   Design Nation that would democratize access to a  design education and bring together top students   from across the country with industry leaders.
(1:09:46) And originally, my plan was to build this   within an organization that already existed at  Princeton, because they had the funding, they   had the resources, they had the expertise in order  to make this a reality. And then, what actually   ended up happening was they too were skeptical of  the business value of design and didn't think it   would be possible for something like this to be  funded.
(1:10:07) And so, I went from building something   in a situation where I thought finances,  expenditures, connections, et cetera, were   totally taken care of, to having none of that  and needing to build it from the ground up.  And, it was funny, one of the best pieces of  advice I got in college was, don't underestimate   the power for .edu email address.
(1:10:30) And I just  went on a spree, cold emailing so many people,   so many executives about this problem that I  was trying to solve. And, what actually ended   up happening was people would hop on the phone  with me, and a lot of the folks who I spoke to,   designers who I really admire, like Daniel  Burke, Jamie [inaudible 01:10:46], et cetera,   were folks who would be like, "Oh my  God, this was such a problem when I was   in college. Of course I'll help you solve it.  I can't believe it hasn't been solved yet.
(1:10:56) "  And so, ultimately, it grew into this conference  that lasted many years, brought together folks   from originally around the country, then more  recently around the world. And ultimately, did   live under that broader organization. But I think,  having the ability to, in the absence of formal   backing or something, still chase after something  and maybe pivot the way that you're thinking about   it, or pivot the way that you are allocating your  own time. Maybe suddenly speakers is not the most  
(1:11:30) important thing, fundraising is the most important  thing. Or, building a hype landing page so that   you seem more legit than a very scrappy few-person  student organization is the most important thing.   And just being quite adaptable when it comes  to resourcing, I think is very important. That's an awesome example.
(1:11:57) It shows another trait,  Mahika, in our archeological study, which has come   up a bunch, and I'm just putting my finger on  it, is just high agency. It feels like you're   just consistently just like, "I'll make this  happen myself. This problem exists. We need more   product designers in school. I will solve that  problem." And I love that.
(1:12:14) And by the way, Design   Nation for folks that want to explore that, how  do they find that? And it's still going, right? Yeah. So, you can Google Design Nation. Okay. And, we have a Instagram page  amongst other things. And,   yeah, last year we had folks like  Stuart Weitzman and Joe Gebbia,   who's one of the co-founders of Airbnb  come and speak, which was super exciting.
(1:12:37) Awesome. And then, who is it  for? It's for students? People   in college that want to learn to be designers? Yeah, it's for design-driven college students.  I think one thing to call out is that one of my   focuses in the early years was to ensure that  this is for, not just capital D designers,   but design driven students.
(1:13:00) So, we also  took engineers who are very design minded   and marketers who are very design minded, et  cetera, because of that core belief that the   most innovative solutions will come out of people  that are operating at this intersectionality. Okay. So we've talked about all kinds of things  you're amazing at. Before we transition to what   you've learned about just building new stuff  at larger companies, which you're very good at,   can you just bullet point the skills you find  you're not good at? I said we would come to   this. What do you think you're not good at?  And we won't go too deep here, unless you want.
(1:13:34) So it's interesting, because I think that there  are many things that we talked about that are   actually a double-edged sword in practice.  So, let's start with the conviction piece.   I think that the good thing about being high  conviction is that you're able to sell forward   and to get people to feel strongly about  something and a next step in the future.  
(1:13:58) I think the downside of that is if there  is less of a history of working together,   there might be skepticism about like, "Oh,  are you just pushing something because you   believe in it? Or are you pushing something  because our users actually needed it?" And so,   in those moments, it becomes really important  to constantly be highlighting user proof points. 
(1:14:17) I think, the second is scrappiness. So, I think  I have a very high ability to thrive in ambiguity   and to pull things together last minute. So,  for example, it's very common that I am editing   a product review deck minutes before we are  about to present, or that I haven't started   until the night before and stay up until 3:00 AM  to do it. And this is somewhat fine.
(1:14:42) But then,   I think that other people don't always love it,  because they're like, "Hey, maybe let's start   earlier next time." I get that. The third piece  would be I get very consumed by the details of   something. And I think in a lot of instances,  this is great.
(1:15:06) Also, at a certain point,   sometimes you want to defer those decisions.  And so, that's also an important skill to learn. Awesome. Thanks for sharing all that. This  touches on something that came up in a   previous podcast episode. Nikhil from Meta had  this really interesting metaphor, where every   superpower has a shadow.
(1:15:26) Basically, everything  you're amazing at, there's something that'll   be a problem, a liability basically for you. And  so, I think, what you're pointing out is you're   amazing at some of these things, but there's  downsides. And I think that's really important   for people to know.
(1:15:39) And we already talked about  just something you believe that I also believe,   it's just, you'll have things you're not good  at, focus on things you're amazing at, and just   getting better at those things, and use that to  achieve, because it ends up being a lot more. Also, building off of that is as you scale  your team, it's really important to be   self-aware of what those blind spots  are and to hire for that.
(1:16:02) Because,   you want individuals to be spiky and  you want team to be well-rounded. That's a great segue to talking about building  completely new things at large companies. So,   what I hear is you're the go-to person  for zero-to-one stuff at Figma, which is   incredible. Figma is one of the most admired,  successful tech companies in the world.
(1:16:21) And,   you're the person people look to build  completely new stuff. So, first of all,   why are you so passionate about this  stuff? Why do you want to be working   on brand new stuff like this? And why is it  important for companies to be good at this? In order for a company to stay competitive, a  company needs to stay entrepreneurial.
(1:16:44) If you   are not constantly thinking about what's  next, defining the industry standard,   seeing around the corner from your competitors,  you will get taken over. That is a reality. And   so, consequently, I personally love to screen for  very entrepreneurial companies and companies that   have that culture.
(1:17:07) And so, Figma has this  huge run with it culture, where run with it   is also one of our core values, and it's really  encouraged that people can just sprint off in a   direction that is seen not as a distraction, but  rather a manifestation of the company's values.  And so, at the company, some of our  most monumental launches have come   out of hackathons and have come out  of bottoms up projects.
(1:17:33) So recently,   this week we had a launch of Multi-edit, which  was a long clamored for a feature where folks   can edit things across multiple frames  at the same time. That was a multi-year,   multi-product long initiative. We have things  like Jambot, which is an AI plugin inside of   FigJam that has come out of an AI hackathon  that we had last year.
(1:17:58) Our entire widgets   platform was originally a hackathon project. And  so, there's this culture of celebrating things- ... project. And so there's this culture  of celebrating things that have been pushed   bottoms up. And so constantly thinking about how  can people within the company be entrepreneurial,   both in terms of getting new products up to users  and in terms of improving internal processes,   is just a culture that you constantly  want to be facilitating and leading into.
(1:18:20) Awesome. And clearly, Figma is very good at this.  Let's dive a little deeper. Say, somebody wants   to make their culture more entrepreneurial or  wants to become better at this individually,   maybe just broadly, what does it take to  do this well, to go from idea to, "Okay,   that's a huge new product for a business"?  What have you learned just broadly,   what are kind of the steps or the  important elements of that, well? I think that there's this interesting metaphor  that you were calling out earlier about a  
(1:18:52) zero-to-one project being like a flame. And flames  are interesting, because they're sort of destined   to die at the end of the day. And I think about  the person who is pushing a zero-to-one idea   as kind of being the keeper of the flame. And in particular, there's this metaphor   that really sticks with me, which is in Greek  mythology, all the gods sit on Mount Olympus,   and there's this Goddess Hestia who is the keeper  of the hearth, and it is her job to always keep   the hearth burning, even when all the gods peace  out to go on their various quests. And I kind of  
(1:19:37) think about the person or the team or the group of  people who are pushing a zero-to-one idea as being   the Hestias or the keepers of the hearth. And it  is your job to stoke the flames and the embers   if they are at risk of dying out.
(1:19:55) And it is also  your job to ensure that the idea can spread like   wildfire and can build that level of hype you need  for an entire company or an entire set of people   to be clamoring for something to get built. And so more concretely, I think that there   are three things you need to do in order  to be successful at bringing an idea into   existence.
(1:20:16) The first is you need to have the  right idea, right? And that's the empathy   piece. That's the piece that you will  get from having conversations day in,   day out with your users. The second is you need to  secure buy-in for that idea. So that's the vision   piece. You need to be able to rally an entire  set of folks, but honestly, most importantly,   your leadership and your team behind an idea.
(1:20:36) And  then, the third is you need to be able to make it   spread like that wildfire. You need to get it  to a point where someone joins the company and   they're like, "Oh, what is that flame burning  there? And how can I learn more about that?" Coming up with a great idea,  getting buy-in for your idea,   and then spreading it within the organization,   what have you learned about how to actually come  up with an idea that is actually a good idea? So it's funny because the current product that  I'm working on actually came out of a conversation  
(1:21:06) or a set of conversations where I was pitching  FigJam to people. And so kind of speaking about   constantly having these user conversations,  I think in order to have the right idea,   there are two key elements. The first is you  need to have that user empathy. You need to   be constantly having conversations with your  users, diving into what are their pain points,   not only about the product that you're working  on, but general perceptions about your company   and also general perceptions about the other tools  or products that they might be using on a daily  
(1:21:38) basis. It's not enough to have a perspective  on how well you are competing in the market,   but you also need to know, like understand  a person's full end-to-end tooling usage.  And then, the second thing is you need to  ensure that what you're kind of working   towards ladders into a company goal.
(1:22:01) And so  something that's very top of mind at Figma   or something that has been very top of mind  at Figma has been how do we go from building   for designers to covering the entire product  development cycle and expanding to non-designers   in particular. And non-designers is kind of this  bucket term that we use for PMs and developers and   marketers and so on and so forth, but how can  we ensure that our tooling suite is reflective   of all the different stakeholders that make  the product development process what it is,   and so I think that, yeah, just constantly  having the conversation with the users and  
(1:22:38) also constantly being anchored around  not what are you currently working on,   but what is the broader company goal is something  that will help you come up with the right idea. Such an important point, basically understanding  the business, not just, "Here's my feature,   here's my product, or here's what feels like  a great cool thing to build.
(1:22:58) " Okay, so that's   the idea getting buy-in. What have you learned  about how to do that? Well, clearly, you've been   very successful, because we've talked about a  lot of these things, building hype, creating   a big vision. What else there that we haven't  talked about that you think is really important? I think the key to being successful at zero-to-one  is to honestly have optimism that borders on   delusion.
(1:23:31) You need to have insane, almost like  reality distortion field where you don't hear   the word no, or at the very least, you translate  it into a not yet. And so I think that in terms   of pitching, I'll be honest, my first few  pitches of this idea were not successful.   What basically happened was kind of like both  conviction, the idea by talking to users,   and then I would have ad hoc conversations with  folks around the company, and I would be like,   "We should do this." And they would be  like, "Maybe.
(1:24:03) " And I would be like, "Okay,   what am I seeing? What are they not seeing?" And  then, what basically happened was we had a PM   off-site where we were talking about strategy  for the next year. And I, again, pitch this,   and it got kind of momentum there, but not really. And then, I think the third time when it actually   stuck was at the Maker Week hackathon.
(1:24:24) And  this was kind of an insane experience for me,   because I was actually hosting our hackathon. So  I was kind of working with our VP of design, Noah,   in order to spread the word about like, "Hey,  everyone pitch your ideas." And to constantly,   hackathons are interesting when they're virtual,  right? Because you don't really know what people   not in your office are doing, right? So you're  constantly thinking about like, "Okay, how can you   hype up the whole company, right? How can you hype  up the SF office with what people are building in  
(1:24:49) New York? And how can you ensure that London stays  included even though there's a limited time zone   overlap," and things like that. And so I was  simultaneously thinking about, "Okay, how do we   keep the momentum of this hackathon running? And  then, also, how do I push this idea bottoms up?"  And I think that something that's really important  when you're making a pitch is to not be daunted by   the scale of your pitch. So, for example, in this  instance, the proposal was basically to introduce  
(1:25:17) a new product. And building a product in a week  is for all intents and purposes kind of crazy,   but this is I think where the scrappiness  piece comes in. You need to be willing to   be very clear about where you're willing to take  the hit on quality or believability and where you   need to push in order to make your thing feel  believable.
(1:25:47) So one example of something that   we did was we literally, in order to make this  new product feel more real, and this was maybe   a two line change in code, was we swapped out the  FigJam icon in our file browser to this new icon.  And adding a whole new entry point is a  lot of work, and you can't do that. But   just swapping something and taking about what  exists and changing the minor things in order   to communicate what is different about your idea  versus what exists today is something that you   really want to lean into. And what basically  happened was that at the end of the week,  
(1:26:17) we had this demo day, and I was going between  introducing each of the demos to doing the demo   and did a little wardrobe change in between. And I  think that what ended up being really great about   presenting an idea like this in a company-wide  forum, which I highly recommend, is that at that   point, it becomes not just you evangelizing the  idea, but your teammates and your colleagues and   your peers evangelizing the idea. And that sense  of momentum carries a lot of weight, I think.
(1:26:48) And this kind of leads into the next bullet  point you shared of spreading the idea across   the company. It feels like this is part of  it just getting it spread in a big powerful   way initially. But what else have you learned  about just getting this to spread across the   company? It gets kind of like this flame  spreading throughout the organization.
(1:27:05) I think something that's very unique about Figma  as compared to other companies is we have a   multi-month plus long staging or dogfooding  process. And so something that was really   interesting to me was... One of the first projects  that I worked on at the company was we were   building sections inside of FigJam. And we had a  problem. We built it.
(1:27:31) We put something on staging,   and I was kind of like, "Okay, cool, it's been on  staging a week, now we can launch, right?" And I   was greeted with like, "No, we can't launch." And I think that leaning into that willingness   to being vulnerable about your product and  this acknowledgement that feedback is a gift,   and that bits and pieces of feedback from across  the company will help your product mature and   get to a place where it's ready to go out the  door is really important. And what's really  
(1:28:02) interesting is this helps the team who's working  on the product, because you're getting feedback,   and that's the most direct benefit of  putting something on staging early.  But the other benefit about putting something on  staging early is that it makes people invested   in your product.
(1:28:22) So if you think about why are  betas so valuable and why are alphas so valuable,   it's because when someone gives you feedback, and  then the team in charge implements that change,   you see that and you're like, "I shaped that part  of the product." Right? And to the extent that you   can get as many people in the company feeling  like they shaped X, Y, Z parts of the product,   I think that's really powerful, because,  then, you kind of are ensuring that there's   this constant feedback loop, and there's this  constant investment in thinking about how can  
(1:28:52) we collectively drive towards success, because  at the end of the day, product development is   a team sport, right? It takes everyone to make  something successful. And so I just think about   putting things early on staging and getting people  involved in the cycle as opening up the doors to   the product development process, and hopefully,  that just elevates the quality of the product.
(1:29:15) Is there anything else you want  to touch on or share or leave   listeners with before we get to  a very exciting lightning round? If you have an insight that only you have,   I think on one hand, you can kind of believe,  "Oh, other people aren't thinking similar to me.   Therefore, maybe, I'm wrong," but I would actually  flip that, because I think if you have an insight   that other people are not seeing, it is even more  on you to get people onto the same page.
(1:29:44) And so to   the extent that you can shout from the rooftops  about all the insights that you're learning,   I think that, in and of itself, creates a more  entrepreneurial culture within the company,   because chances are other people  will see you doing that. They'll be   inspired to contribute in the same way as well.
(1:30:02) I think the last thing that I would say is, which   is maybe an aspect that we did not touch on, is  that understanding motivations is, in my opinion,   one of the keys to running a team successfully  and driving an idea forward. So, for example,   if you think about the composition of a product  team, you have engineers, you have designers,   you have researchers, data scientists, et  cetera, and different people want to be   involved in the kind of product visioning phase  to a different extent.
(1:30:34) There's some people who do   want a solution handed to them, because for them,  the most exciting part of the process is to find   the technical solution in the code. On the other  hand, there are other people who find it really   hard to feel passionately about a thing that they  have not contributed to. And so I think to the   extent that you can understand these motivations  of your team, of your leadership, of your peers,   and constantly ensure that you are catering  to the individual, as opposed to the average,   that is what, in my opinion, leads to  one of the highest-functioning teams.
(1:31:11) Such a cool point. It comes back to  the personality tests that you spoke   of earlier. Is that the best way to  figure this out? Is it more just watch   people and try to guess at what they're  most excited about [inaudible 01:31:21]- Oh, I think you have to directly ask  them.
(1:31:26) So anytime someone joins my team,   especially on the engineering side, because I  think this is where there's the greatest variance,   I will literally ask, " How much do you like  being involved in product decisions?" And to   the extent that you can take decisions in  the open, that is excellent. And even if   the decision is something along the lines of  like, "Okay, we have four options," and you   can go in with a leading point of view,  but giving everyone the opportunity to   voice their perspective and push back, if they  want to, I think that that's very powerful.
(1:32:03) Such a good tip. I feel like I could ask  you questions for at least two more hours,   but we're not going to do that. Maybe,  we'll have round two some day. With that,   we've reached our very exciting  lightning round. Are you ready? I am ready. Mihika, first question, what are two or three  books that you recommended most to other people? Yeah, I'll start by saying that I am  immediately skeptical of anyone who   has not read Harry Potter. So, if you're one  of those people, go read Harry Potter. Maybe,  
(1:32:32) it contributes to creativity. I don't know. Now, we're talking about every book in  the series, or at least the one book? No, no. You have to read the entire series, and  you have to read it in order. It's actually funny,   when I was in kindergarten, my mom bought  the fifth book, and then the person at   the bookstore was like, "No, no." Like,  "No, no." We were like, "Okay, got it.
(1:32:55) "   And then, the others that I would recommend are  from a fiction perspective. I think Pachinko by   Min Jin Lee is incredibly beautiful and  powerful. It's like a multi-generational   Korean saga. I think I'm personally just  motivated and moved by large scale things.   So to see a single story traverse so many  generations was very fascinating to me. 
(1:33:17) And then, from a more businessy book perspective,  which is maybe more what you're getting at,   I think that I honestly pseudo steer clear of  how-to books, but one that has had a particularly   large impact on me is Creativity Inc. by  Ed Catmull. And this is about the founding   story and scaling of Pixar.
(1:33:41) And what was so  interesting to me about this book was it basically   talks about how you create a process around  cultivating creativity. And it's interesting,   because creativity is so unencumbered and process  is the opposite, so that's very fascinating. My favorite lesson from that book is that  it sticks with me as the ugly baby metaphor,   which feels like so tied to the way you think and   operate. And I won't get into it.
(1:34:02) By  the way, have you read The Overstory? I have not. I'll add that to my list. I feel like, based on the  way you described Pachinko,   this is a book for you. It's  a multi-generational family   story that I did not actually finish. It's  very long, but I feel like you were there. Okay. There you go. I'll go order it. Okay.
(1:34:22) Favorite recent movie or TV show? Favorite recent TV show would  definitely be Severance. Movie, or shall we move on? Oh, movie, I recently watched Dune 2 and Dune  1 in the span of a week. It was really fun.   I watched Dune 2, because someone asked me  to co-host a premiere of Dune 2 with them,   and I was like, "Okay, sounds good,  sounds cool, but I need to watch Dune 1.
(1:34:45) " Good choice. I just watched Dune 2. I don't know   if a more epic movie can be  made. I was just gripped. The visuals were stunning. Like not breathing. Yeah. It's out of control. I watched it  IMAX. I think that was a good call,   but it was stressful. Favorite interview question  they like to ask folks when you're hiring.
(1:35:02) I like to ask people what motivates  them, but also, people often ask me,   what is my favorite hot seat question, which  I think is kind of similar. And my answer to   that is that it's highly dependent on  the person, and there's no go-to hot   seat question. And I almost feel the  same way about interview questions.
(1:35:20) Favorite product you recently  discovered that you love? Speaking about hype, I am kind of obsessed  with the browser company, Arc onboarding flow,   specifically the onboarding flow. I think that  they do such a good job of amping you up for   not only the larger change that they're trying to  make in terms of personal operating system, but of   showing you to what extent their team thinks about  the details of the product, where a lot of other   products might cut corners. And I think their  ability to communicate the ethos of their product  
(1:35:58) through that is really powerful. So that's one. And then I think the second is in the AI space.   I'm really excited by Pika, which is video  generation, video editing software. I think that,   in my mind, one of the biggest shortcomings of  AI, the way that a lot of people are building   it today is that it's optimized for the demo or  optimized for the tweet, right? And it's basically   this situation where I think about it as, in my  mind, one of the biggest goals of AI right now  
(1:36:29) is the black boxification of AI, because it's not  really useful to enter a prompt and get an output   that you can't interact with, because then it's  like, if something's a little bit off, what are   you going to do? You're kind of stuck.
(1:36:45) But I  think Pika is doing a really great job of not   just investing in the foundational video models,  but also giving you the ability to manipulate the   output. And so I'm excited about that approach,  and I hope that more companies take you from that. Awesome, good choices on Arc. Whenever  anyone ask me for a great onboarding follow,   that's the one I point people to.
(1:37:04) And we  had Josh Miller on the podcast in the past,   and I was proud that he pinned our interview  as top of his Twitter feed for a year,   which made me really happy. Do you have  a favorite life motto that you often come   back to or share with friends or family  that you find useful in life or in work? Yeah, "Life is a game of expectations.
(1:37:25) " And  so speaking of books and movies and things   like that, I will never ever watch a movie  trailer or read the back cover of a book,   because I think it means that  you're going into it with too   many expectations. It either tells you  all the punchlines, or it tells you the   foundational backstory or something like  that.
(1:37:42) And I think that, to the extent,   that you go in either with no expectations or low  expectations, that's the key to enjoying life. I love that tip. I recently learned the same  piece of advice from Kevin Kelly's recent book   where it's just a book of little tidbits  of advice that he's learned over his life,   and one of them is like never watch the  trailer if you're going to watch the movie,   and I've been doing that ever since.
(1:38:02)   I think that's an awesome piece of   advice. Final question. We talked about the  Figgy's. You mentioned there's an award for   PM least likely to write a PRD. Was  that you won the award for chance? I think it was me and Sho tied. Okay, great. I guessed correctly.  Amazing. Mihika, you're... Everything,   I hope you'd be on this podcast, I  feel like, we could have talked for,   I keep saying this, but at least two  more hours maybe, we'll have a follow-up.
(1:38:25) I'd love that. Thank you so much for being here and for making  time. Two final questions. Where can folks find   you if they want to reach out and follow up on  anything? And how can listeners be useful to you? Yeah, you can find me on Twitter. I'm @mihikapoor.
(1:38:40)   It's kind of my first name and last name smushed   together. And in terms of how users can  be useful to me, so one is come to Config,   we will be announcing both this new product,  but also so many cool things that the company   is working on. A lot of very exciting AI launches  and more. And I think that having the community   come together is a very special moment. So hope to  see you there.
(1:39:05) Cough, cough, try the new product   when it comes out. And I don't know, I'm always  on the lookout for cool new products. I like to   be someone who tries things out early, so to the  extent that you see things, send them my way. There's going to be so many people  anticipating this new product. Oh, no, yeah. There's going to be like- We should- ... holy moly.
(1:39:20) Please have low expectations. Okay. And the way we'll know is  are you pitching and presenting it,   or how do we know this is going  to be your product once we see it? It'll probably be in the opening  keynote, which is done by Dylan,   but I'll probably give a Config talk on  it as well.
(1:39:39) So that's how you will know,   and I'll probably tweet about it.  What I was actually going to do is   to release the original vision deck when  it launches, so you can look out for that. We'll be watching. I will be at Config. Can't wait to see you there. Potentially on stage.
(1:39:57) Can't reveal  yet what's happening exactly,   but I think it's going to be awesome. Anyway,  Mihika, thank you again so much for being here. Thank you for having me, Lenny. This was  such a fun conversation. It was such an   honor and a privilege to be on the podcast.  So, really, thank you so much for having me. The honor was mine. Bye, everyone. Thank you so  much for listening.
